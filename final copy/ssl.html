                Have you ever wondered if the website you visit is secure? Have you ever noticed the lock icon on your web browser?

            <h2>What is SSL and TLS</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</b> 
                was created in the mid-1990s by a 
                company named Netscape. There were 3 types of versions of SSL, SSL 1.0,
                SSL 2.0, and SSL 3.0. Although SSL 1.0 was never released publicly. 
                After SSL 3.0, which was released in 1996, there was a new version 
                released in 1999. This new version of SSL was called 
                <b>Trasport Layer Security (TLS)</b>. 
                TLS was very similar to SSL 3.0. They are often referred to as SSL/TLS. 
                SSL keeps your connection to the website secure. It also keeps any sensitive 
                data being sent secure and impossible for anyone other than you and the website
                 to see or access what you send. All the data sent using SSL is encrypted. 
                 Websites using SSL/TLS will have a padlock beside the URL.

            <h2>How do I know if my website is secure?</h2>
            <p>
                It is simple and very easy to tell if a website is secure. In the URL of the website, 
                if it starts with HTTPS, it is secure.

            <p>  			
                <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b>
                , when you send data with HTTP, it is just a 
                bunch of lines and is very easy for anyone to see and read. Therefore, sending 
                sensitive data using HTTP is very dangerous since it is not protected in any way.
                <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</b> 
                is the secure version of HTTP. It uses
                SSL or TLS to encrypt the data. If someone were to try to see the data, it would
                be encrypted. All they would see is just a bunch of random characters. Encryption
                is taking information and turning it into a secret code so no one except the 
                intended recipient can see the information. TLS uses public-key encryption, 
                which is a set of two keys, a public and a private key the public key is granted
                to the client from the server’s SSL Certificate with the public and private keys
                they decide on more keys called session keys to further secure the information.
                It is important to make sure you are using HTTPS when submitting sensitive data
                like credit card information so that your information stays private and isn’t
                exposed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever visiting a website and planning on entering any information make 
                sure to check if it is using HTTPS if you want to learn more about HTTPS, 
                encryption, or SSL/TLS check out
