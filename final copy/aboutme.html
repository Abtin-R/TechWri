What I like most about technology would have to be the fact that complicated tasks become simple. The purpose of technology in this world is to make everyday tasks easier. If you look at anything on your phone or computer, they all simplify a task. For example, planes speed up the process of travel computers replacing paper documents. Your phone has a built-in camera, so you don't have to inconvenience yourself by picking up a Canon every time you want to take a photo. The whole point of technology is to make us work less for the same results.

                                I have a couple of hobbies that I enjoy. My favorite hobby would have to be fishing. I am a big fisherman and started fishing around three years ago with my grandpa and dad. I had gone fishing a couple of times before then, but I stopped because I hadn't caught any fish for an entire year. When my grandpa came over from the states, he got me into fishing and taught me a couple of tips and tricks to get better at fishing. Then on the third day, I went fishing, and I finally caught my first ever fish. It was after that I enjoyed it. Fishing became such a big hobby of mine after that day.

                                I have a huge passion, and it is fishing. Although fishing is a hobby of mine, it is also something I pursue as it is a potential carrier for me. I take fishing very seriously and also fish for fun. By taking fishing seriously, I target trophy fish to receive awards from the M.A.A.M (Master Angler Awards Manitoba).  I have already received a couple rewards from M.A.A.M, and I plan to soon start competing in fishing tournaments, although I would like to make sure the tournaments I compete in are putting the fishâ€™s health above all. It is extremely important to release the large fish back safely as they are the breeders and ensure that there will be fish for future generations.
